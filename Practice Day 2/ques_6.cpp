/*Question: Create a dynamic object named dhoni of the following class. Donâ€™t use a constructor here, that means you need to fill the data by yourself.
Cricketer
{
	jersey_no;
	country;
}
Then make another dynamic object named kohli and copy the data of the dhoni object to kohli and after that delete the dhoni object. Then print the jersey_no and country of kohli object.
